## Overview

**Sacemly** is an AI-powered summarization system designed to support students and independent learners by transforming lengthy and complex texts into concise, personalized summaries. The system focuses on preserving the learner’s unique writing style, highlighting key information, and providing a clear and effective learning aid that adapts over time.

The project is built entirely from the ground up, without relying on pre-trained language models. All core algorithms—such as word embeddings, context modeling, and importance ranking—are implemented manually to ensure a deep understanding of the underlying mechanisms.

## Project Purpose

The primary goal of Sacemly is to enhance the way learners interact with educational content by offering a streamlined, intelligent summarization tool. It aims to:

* Reduce cognitive load during reading and review.
* Deliver summaries that reflect the user's personal writing style.
* Highlight the most critical information within the content.
* Enable more effective and personalized study workflows.

This project is part of a larger initiative to develop AI solutions that are transparent, customizable, and educational by design.

## Key Features

* **Personalized Summarization**: The system adapts to the user’s writing patterns to produce summaries in a familiar and natural tone.
* **Importance-Weighted Analysis**: Each part of the text is evaluated and scored based on its semantic importance, ensuring that essential ideas are emphasized.
* **Style Preservation**: The system preserves the user’s voice, vocabulary, and phrasing throughout the summarization process.
* **Document and PDF Support**: Input can be provided through plain text, PDF files, or structured educational materials.
* **Social Content Integration**: The system supports the import of educational content from online posts, forums, or transcripts.
* **Privacy-First Design**: All data remains local or within a user-controlled cloud environment, ensuring full data privacy.
* **Adaptive Learning System**: Sacemly improves over time by analyzing user feedback and past summaries.

---

## Target Audience

Sacemly is designed for:

* University students seeking efficient study tools.
* High school students preparing for exams or assignments.
* Independent learners managing large volumes of reading material.
* Educators and instructors preparing learning materials.
* Individuals with attention difficulties or reading fatigue.

## System Architecture

The system operates in the following stages:

1. **Text Input**: The user provides content via file upload or direct text input.
2. **Preprocessing**: Text is cleaned, segmented, and normalized for analysis.
3. **Style Learning**: The system identifies unique stylistic patterns from the user's existing content.
4. **Importance Detection**: Using manually implemented NLP algorithms, the system scores and ranks textual segments.
5. **Summary Generation**: A custom summary is generated, preserving both style and substance.
